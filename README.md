# Spatial Selectivity Estimation using Optimizer Feedback
This GitHub repository contains code and resources related to the research project on Selectivity Estimation for Spatial Filters using Optimizer Feedback from a Machine Learning perspective. The project focuses on leveraging optimizer feedback to improve the estimation of selectivity for multi-dimensional spatial predicates. Various Machine Learning models, including neural networks, tree-based models, and instance-based models, are explored to address this challenging task efficiently. The repository also includes datasets and some learned models used in the study.
